# CDFTSVM
Coordinate Descent Fuzzy Twin Support Vector Machine  for Classification

CDFTSVM has two distinguished advantages: (1) An effective
fuzzy membership function is produced for removing the noise
incurred by the contaminant inputs. (2) A coordinate descent
strategy with shrinking by active set is used to deal with the
computational complexity brought by the high dimensional input.
